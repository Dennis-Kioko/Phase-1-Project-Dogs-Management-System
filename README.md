# Project Idea: Dogs Management System
- For this project, I am build a Single Page Application (SPA).I will be integrating.The three fundamentals of frontend development that is DOM manipulation,communicating withe the server and event listeners built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Problem Statement
- The current system for managing dogs' inventory is manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. The lack of a centralized system makes it challenging to track inventory levels, monitor dog details, and update stock information in real-time. This inefficiency leads to difficulties in maintaining accurate records, managing new dogs, and providing customers with up-to-date information on available dog items.

## Solution
- To address the challenges posed by the current inventory management system, we propose the development of a dogs Inventory Management System. This system will be a web-based application that streamlines the process of tracking, managing, and updating dogs' inventory. By leveraging modern technologies and tools, the system aims to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance overall inventory management.

## Key Features and Requirements:
- Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and efficient data entry.
- Display a list of inventory items with their names (dogs).
- Add a new dog to the inventory using a form with fields for name,breed, quantity (number of dogs), and description.
- Edit existing dogs by clicking on an "Edit" button.
- View detailed information about a dog by clicking on its name.
- Include an image gallery for each dog, allowing users to view dogs visually.
- Delete dogs from the inventory by clicking on a "Delete" button.
- Integrate with external APIs (e.g., dog databases) to fetch additional details and enrich dog information.

## MVP Focus:
- Display a list of dogs.
- Implement functionality to add, edit, and delete dogs.
- Ensure that each dog displays relevant data.
